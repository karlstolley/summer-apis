        <p>
          Each week, we will all work together through a problem related to the week’s readings and
          your progress on the two larger projects. You should post to Basecamp <b>as</b> you are
          working on the problems. Part of their purpose is to help everyone in the class learn to
          work together and compare different approaches to solving challenging problems.

        <h3>Project One: Static API Consumption and Display</h3>
        <small>Due June 17, 11:59pm&nbsp;CT</small>
      </header>
      <section class="description">
        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          You will create an Express.js-backed application on top of Node.js that consumes API data
          and presents the data in a useful format tied to some specific user task or information
          need. Your display will be a single HTML page, styled with CSS and progressively enhanced
          with JavaScript as necessary in the browser. Think of your display as something like an
          information dashboard. Your display will contain limited user interaction, other than
          perhaps modifying views of data. But no interaction should trigger the fetching of
          additional data (that will be the focus of Project Two).
        </p>

        <h4>Project Goals</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Develop familiarity with the conventions of API documentation, including coverage of
            authentication, endpoints, responses, and acceptable use as governed by both
            professional ethics and legal documents, such as terms of service
          </li>
          <li>
            Programmatically access and parse API data in a variety of data-serialization formats,
            such as CSV, XML, or JSON
          </li>
          <li>
            Leverage JavaScript and the asynchronous features of Node.js to consume API data and
            deliver it in web-friendly formats, using the Express.js framework
          </li>
          <li>
            Effectively structure, design, and present consumed API data to serve specific user
            needs in a responsively designed web-based data display
          </li>
          <li>
            Thoughtfully evaluate and adopt only the most standards-compliant documentation,
            libraries, and development techniques for accessing, authenticating to, and parsing API
            data
          </li>
          <li>
            Write valid, well-formed semantic HTML; error-free, backward- and forward-compatible CSS;
            and error-free, progressively enhanced JavaScript over HTML pages that continue to
            function in the absence of JavaScript
          </li>
          <li>
            Make use of validators, linters, and custom test suites to ensure code quality both in
            terms of expected function and adherence to published standards and documentation
          </li>
          <li>
            Effectively comment on and format source code for maximum readability
          </li>
          <li>
            Track the development of a project over time and collaborate with others using version

      <section class="requirements">
        <h4>General Requirements</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All source files in UTF-8/Unicode character encoding with Unix-style line endings (LF),
            entabbed with spaces (two spaces per tab)
          </li>
          <li>
            Organized, readable source that is hand-written and original (no WYSIWYGs or
            code-generators, no Bootstrap or other off-the-shelf frameworks). A JavaScript framework
            for basic DOM manipulation is permissible, such as jQuery or a lightweight alternative
            such as Umbrella JS or Shoestring.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make use of validators and linters to ensure the quality of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
          </li>
          <li>
            A Git repository with frequent commits and meaningful commit messages that accurately
            reflect each set of changes that you make
          </li>
          <li>
            Your GitHub repository must contain ONLY the files and commits from this project
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Back-End Requirements</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use the <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a> framework to develop your
            app
          </li>
          <li>
            Generate the skeleton of your app using the
            <a href="http://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html">Express application generator</a>;
            your initial Git commit should immediately follow generating the skeletal app that way
          </li>
          <li>
            Properly fill out and maintain your <code>package.json</code> file to track additional
            dependencies and version your project
          </li>
          <li>
            Rely solely on asynchronous patterns to fetch API data on the server side, through your
            app
          </li>
          <li>
            Project must be built to deliver to the browser only one valid well-formed HTML file,
            one valid CSS file, and one JavaScript file.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Front-End Requirements</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files should all be indented with 2 spaces per level of
            indent; indent all CSS style rules inside the declaring block, and further indent all
            rules and blocks inside your media queries. Indent inside of all blocks in JavaScript.
          </li>
          <li>
            Semantically structured text-based content to accompany any media elements (image,
            audio, video). Make use of the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> and
            <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> tags
          </li>
          <li>
            The opening lines of your <code>screen.css</code> file should be the Eric Meyer reset
            CSS styles
          </li>
          <li>
            Use of only relative units (<code>em</code>, <code>rem</code>, <code>vm</code>,
            <code>%</code>) in your CSS; no <code>px</code>, <code>pt</code>, or other absolute
            units are permitted in your CSS
          </li>
          <li>
            Use at least three min-width media queries to enhance mobile-first styles for larger
            screens
          </li>
          <li>
            Use JavaScript only for progressive enhancement. All site content and basic
            functionality (e.g., clicking links, viewing images and other media, scrolling,
            submitting forms) must still be available even in the absence of JavaScript.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Absolutely no</b> <code>on-</code> or other deprecated event attributes in your HTML.
            Handle all events via event listeners in your JavaScript. The only element of your HTML
            that should contain any references to JavaScript should be a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>
            element that loads your JavaScript file, and possibly also your DOM-manipulation
            framework. In other words, keep your JavaScript unobtrusive to progressively enhance
            your HTML.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid using JavaScript to manipulate your CSS whenever possible. Limit client-side
            JavaScript to manipulating the DOM, including adding and removing state classes, and
            keep style information and transitions where they belong: in your CSS file.

        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          You will build upon and improve your work from Project One and create a more interactive
          system for navigating API data, including additional data requests based on user input,
          if necessary. However, if your API requests already include additional data, you might
          only need to manipulate what’s already there. Let your API and your user interactions be
          your guide.

        <p>

        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          <b>For students enrolled in the 569 section</b>: The instructor will assign you a common
          data-serialization format, such as JSON, XML, or CSV. You will then create a <a
          href="https://gist.github.com/">GitHub Gist</a> containing a brief description of the
          format, including its history and development, as well as links to documentation of the
          format, examples of the format you find on the internet, and Node.js core libraries and
          third-party modules for parsing or delivering the format. You will post the link to your
          Gist on Basecamp as a reference for all students in the class. The instructor will also
          link to your Gist from the <a href="../#links">Links</a> page on the course site.
