      <h3>Course Description</h3>
      <p>
        This course covers fundamental principles and methods for programmatically accessing and
        parsing data returned by internet-available data APIs. The course guides students in
        carefully examining the structure of API endpoints expressed as URLs and the conventions of
        RESTful architecture. Students will learn to locate and read the documentation for data APIs
        and gain familiarity with API documentation conventions, while also approaching
        documentation with a  healthy degree of skepticism. Students will also engage in a thorough
        study of three common, platform-neutral data-serialization formats: comma-separated values
        (CSV), Extensible Markup Language (XML), and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).
      </p>
      <p>
        In anticipation of the problems of parsing API data at scale, the course emphasizes
        approaches to non-blocking I/O through JavaScript’s growing set of asynchronous features and
        patterns. Students will build on their existing knowledge of JavaScript to begin to write
        next-generation JavaScript according to the ECMAScript 6, 7, and 8 specifications both in
        the browser and server-side, in Node.js. Although JavaScript is the course’s shared
        programming language, the overall principles of API consumption the course covers are
        applicable to any language capable of opening remote URLs, receiving data, and parsing the
        result.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, the course looks at building interfaces for end users to query API data and
        receive useful results targeted to specific tasks or informational needs. While the course
        emphasizes the consumption and manipulation of API data, the course concludes by looking at
        techniques, approaches, and conventions for producing a basic data API for others to
        consume.
      </p>
      <h3>Course Outcomes</h3>
      <p>
        Students completing this course will learn to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Recognize the conventions of API documentation, including coverage of authentication,
          endpoints, responses, and acceptable use as governed by both professional ethics and legal
          documents, such as terms of service
        </li>
        <li>
          Programmatically access and parse API data in a variety of data-serialization formats,
          including CSV, XML, and JSON
        </li>
        <li>
          Leverage JavaScript and the asynchronous features of Node.js to consume API data and

          data
        </li>
        <li>
          Write valid, well-formed semantic HTML; error-free, backward- and forward-compatible CSS;
          and error-free, progressively enhanced JavaScript over HTML pages that continue to
          function in the absence of JavaScript
        </li>
        <li>
          Make use of validators, linters, and custom test suites to ensure code quality both in
          terms of expected function and adherence to published standards and documentation
        </li>
        <li>
          Effectively comment on and format source code for maximum readability
        </li>
        <li>

      <h3>Course Objectives</h3>
      <p>
        At the conclusion of this course, successful students will be able to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Explain the client and server architecture of the internet and related web technologies
          for the delivery and consumption of data APIs

    <section id="assignments">
      <h3>Assignment Submission</h3>
      <p>
        All major projects for this course will be submitted via email to the instructor, at
        karl.stolley@gmail.com, as will your initial Weekly Problem (thereafter, the instructor
        will directly check your fork of the Weekly Problems repository for your work).
        Emails should <b>not</b> include email attachments, but rather URLs pointing to your
        project’s Git repository. Examples will be shared on Basecamp.
      </p>
      <h3>Late Work</h3>
      <p>
        I do not accept late work. All work must be submitted before the date and time specified in
        each project description. Weekly Problems are due Sunday nights. <b>My deadlines, including
        for draft work, are no different from exam dates in classes that have exams.</b> Treat them
        accordingly.
      </p>
      <h3>Participation</h3>
      <p>
        <b>This is a discussion-based course. There is no lecture component or videos.</b> Your
        active participation in reading, problem, and project discussions is required both for your
        own success in the class, and for the success of the class as a whole: 50% of your grade is
        based on your participation in discussions. I do not give reading quizzes, but I assign a
        lot of reading. And I expect you to be prepared to discuss that reading all week long on
        Basecamp. A participation grade of A means you’re posting an average of 12 or more times per
        week, and that your posts include both discussion threads that you initiate, and comments on
        threads initiated by other students and the instructor. While in most classes you're
        probably encouraged to come up with good answers, this class is equally weighted to reward
        you for asking good questions. A grade of B means you’re posting about 10 times a week. A C
        is around 8 posts per week, and anything less than that is a failing, zero grade for
        participation, which by simple math will translate into a failing grade for the course.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="technology-policy">
      <h3>Course Technology Policy</h3>
      <p>
        Technology is an essential part of learning and day-to-day living. It is therefore
        essential to this class. You are just as responsible for learning to command various
        technologies as for any other course content. Difficulty with technology is not an
        acceptable excuse for being unprepared for class or late with assignments.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are having trouble with technology or any other material covered in this course,
        it is your professional responsibility to do research beyond the resources and guidance
        provided in class and find supplemental materials that work for you. I also encourage
        all students to meet with me during my office hours or at another arranged time. I
        prefer that you contact me via Basecamp Ping, email, or GChat well in advance of assignment
        and project deadlines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that posting to Basecamp for help with broken or malfunctioning work is far better than
        turnin in a project with an excuse like “I just didn’t get it.” For most of the semester, it
        is expected that you’ll show up with broken work. When you’re learning, effort is more
        important than perfection. Just be sure to put in the effort early, and not the night before
        a project is due.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, I have asked you to sign up for a GitHub account for this class. Note that GitHub
        accounts are public, as are most social-type accounts. <b>To protect your privacy you are
        certainly allowed to use a pseudonym/alias for GitHub and any other account.</b> You may
        also push to repositories that you keep private, so long as you add the instructor as a
        collaborator, for grading purposes. At the same time, you might want to think about the high
        value of establishing GitHub and other accounts under your own name or professional alias.
        Public accounts where you conduct yourself professionally might well be an asset to your
        online presence, improving the search results that future schools or employers turn up when
        they look for you on Google and elsewhere.

    <section id="academic-integrity">
      <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
      <p>
        As with any course at IIT, you are expected to uphold
        <a href="https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook/fine-print/code-academic-honesty">the Code of Academic Honesty</a>
        as described in the
        <a href="https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook">IIT Student Handbook</a>. All
        work for this course must be your own original effort, including print and digital page
        design and computer code. Summarizations and quotations of text, as well as any use of
        open-source code libraries and images not of your own making, should be clearly cited as
        legally and ethically warranted and rhetorically appropriate. Access, storage,
        dissemination, and other use of data from third-party sources must conform to the
        source’s terms of service, licensing, and other relevant legal and ethical restrictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are at all uncertain as to whether you are submitting work that in whole or in
        part may violate the Code of Academic Honesty, please contact me immediately and before
        the work is due. The consequences of academic dishonesty are severe. Any student who
        violates the Code of Academic Honesty will be subject to expulsion from this course with
        a failing grade, and I will report the student to the Dean of the School of Applied
        Technology, who may take additional disciplinary action, including reporting
        violations to the relevant offices of Undergraduate or Graduate Academic Affairs.

      <p>
        Students who have any difficulty (either permanent or temporary) that might affect their
        ability to perform in class should contact me privately, either in person or electronically,
        at the start of the semester or as a documented difficulty arises. Methods, materials,
        or deadlines will be adapted as necessary to ensure equitable participation for all
        students.
