  <h2>Learn Data APIs and Full-Stack JavaScript</h2>
  <p>
    Spend the early part of your summer interacting with web-available data APIs for exchanging and
    mashing up content and data, while extending your skills to include server-side JavaScript with
    Node.js.
  </p>
  <p>
    This lectureless, discussion-based course will open with a study of APIs in the classical sense:
    as interfaces into programming languages and core modules, specifically JavaScript. An
    understanding and command of JavaScript’s APIs in the browser and server-side in Node.js will
    prepare us to explore and manipulate APIs that deliver data in lightweight data serialization
    formats (e.g., JSON) in a RESTful architecture. Students will have the opportunity to focus on a
    specific use of APIs, such as visualization, “scraping” for the purposes of creating datasets
    for research, or building custom and novel visual interfaces for interacting with a particular
    dataset or service. Throughout the course, students will encounter and learn to address
    challenges surrounding licensing, API request limits, and other legal, ethical, and technical
    issues surrounding terms of service (TOS) and documentation.

  <h2>The Hard Sell: Take This Class</h2>
  <p>
    Whether or not you have professional ambitions in web development, there is no denying the
    importance of accessing and manipulating data APIs. Additionally, this class introduces or
    reinforces many higher-level principles and practices that are useful regardless of your
    professional specialization:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Effectively tracking the development of active open-source projects
    </li>
    <li>
      Better understanding the processes of authenticating to third-party services and acting within
      the bounds of terms of service
    </li>
    <li>
      Engaging in collaborative, open development on GitHub while maintaining the security of assets
      such as API keys and tokens
    </li>
    <li>
      Gaining familiarity with JavaScript-based methods and generalizable patterns for asynchronous,
      non-blocking I/O
    </li>
    <li>
      Exploring full-stack development that closely knits the client- and server-side logic and
      execution through standards-compliant forms of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
    </li>
    <li>
      Leveraging and customizing consoles and loggers to improve your debugging game
    </li>
    <li>
      Pursuing test-driven development (TDD) to ensure code quality and internal consistency, and to
      streamline code reviews
    </li>
  </ul>

      <b>My policy for assigning books:</b> they are all required in the edition indicated. The
      total retail pricetag for required books an entire course should be less than $100 (this one
      is $84.85 on the high end, assuming you opt for the electronic editions at full list price),
      and each book should be worthy of a place on your bookshelf or electronic device of choice
      long after the class has ended.

  <h2>Major Projects</h2>
  <p>
    There will be three major projects in this class: An individually developed browser-based app,
    an individually developed server-side alpha app, and a collaboratively developed server-side
    beta app. Additionally, graduate students will be expected to more deeply investigate both a
    core module from Node.js and a common data serialization format (e.g., JSON, XML, CSV, SOAP,
    YAML) and serve as in-house consultants on them for everyone else in the class.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="technology">
  <h2>Required Tech Setup</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A Unix-like operating system (Linux, BSD, macOS, etc.). Virtualized Linux is fine, but Windows
      is not.
    </li>
    <li>
      A plain-text editor that highlights HTML, CSS, JavaScript syntax, and that is extensible to
      highlighting common data-serialization and templating formats. Atom is a fine choice, if you
      have no preferred editor or are looking to try something new.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Node.js JavaScript runtime.
    </li>
    <li>
      A command-line Git installation and GitHub account.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Full setup details will be emailed to registered students ahead of the first week of class.
